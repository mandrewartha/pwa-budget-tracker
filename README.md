# Budget Tracker

This budget tracker allows you to keep an eye on your finances whether or not you are connected to the internet. Using a webmanifest and service worker this app can still be used offline without connecting to the database. The added budget items are cached and sent to the database when the page reconnects to the internet. The site is deployed using MongoDB.
